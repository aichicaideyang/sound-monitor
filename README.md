# sound-monitor
a sound monitor(based on ov2640,vga,sound sensor,mp3) verilog fpga.
This project is the BHW of this semester.
Due to my poor programming ability ,I have looked through many reference.Especially @ https://github.com/lllbbbyyy/FPGA-OV2640.
The main function is that when there is any sound in the range, the sound sensor will generate a warning signal.That will display a warning picture in the VGA, and a warning sound in
the MP3.
Due to the lack of time,there exists lots of bugs such as that the screen is not clear.
If you have any ideas, contact me @1752935@tongji.edu.cn
